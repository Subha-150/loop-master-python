# loop-master-python
This project contains loop_tasks.py, a single-file resource designed to showcase how loops work in Python. It is intended as a learning tool for understanding how to automate repetitive tasks, handle data sequences, and control program flow using logic.
🚀 Features Included
Sequential Counting: Printing numbers 1–100 efficiently.
Time-Based Logic: A functional countdown timer using while loops and the time module.
Flow Control: Practical implementation of break (to stop execution) and continue (to skip specific items).
String Processing: Iterating through characters to analyze text data.
Mathematical Automation: Generating multiplication tables using dynamic variables.
Advanced Range Usage: Using steps to filter data (e.g., extracting even numbers).
Real-World Context: Scenarios including security scanning, file processing, and grade evaluation.
🧠 Concepts CoveredFor Loops: Best for iterating over a fixed sequence.
While Loops: Best for running code until a specific condition is met.
Range Function: $range(start, stop, step)$ syntax.
Conditional Integration: Combining if/else statements inside loops for complex decision-making.
